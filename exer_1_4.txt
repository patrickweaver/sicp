Exercise 1.4:
Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

- - - - - - - - - - -

If b is greater than 0, add it to a, otherwise, (b is negative), subtract it from a, which is equivalent to adding the corresponding positive number.
